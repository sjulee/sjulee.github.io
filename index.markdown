I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, advised by [Dr. Gian-Gabriel Garcia](https://giangabrielgarcia.com/). My research interests lie broadly in problems motivated by health modeling and health policy applications. I am especially interested in equitable solutions to medical decision-making problems and interpretable machine learning algorithms in healthcare.

I received my B.E. and B.A. in Engineering Sciences with a concentration in Mechanical Engineering from Dartmouth College. I am a recipient of the Morris Fellowship and the President's Fellowship at Georgia Tech.
